    <h1>Tomato Soup</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lovely, simple flavor. I omitted both the margarine (and if I had wanted the extra calories, I would have used
        butter for its superior taste) and sugar, which is unnecessary in properly prepared tomato recipes. Also cut the
        soda to a mere sprinkle. The result was perfection. I incorporated milk instead of cream for a lighter, fresher
        flavor. For those of you who have had problems with the cream curdling, try tempering the cream. After heating
        it, add a spoonful of the hot soup into it and stir it in. Add another couple of spoonfuls and stir. After
        adding about a cup of hot soup this way, whisk your cream mixture into the pot of hot soup. The soup should be
        at the barest simmer, not a rippin' boil. Possibilities for garnishes of your bowls of soup include julienne
        strips of fresh basil leaves, a tsp of freshly grated Parmesan or Asiago, or finely minced pepperoni.
